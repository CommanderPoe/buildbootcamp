#### Intro

We are going to be using an environment that will run in the browser, it is going to be really close to a dev environment. It will have a bitcoin run node running on it. 
<br/>

#### Steps to follow
1. Sign up for GitHub.
2. Sign up for GitPod.
3. Create GitPod Workspace.

Feel free to copy the environment and start playing with it -> [gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/justinmoon/exercises). It is basically a repo with all the info inside.
<br/>

#### Next

You will be presented with a text editor (VSC) running on the browser where you can navigate the folders and the scripts. We will be working from here.
